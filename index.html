    <h1>VPN Cop Plugin Documentation</h1>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>VPN Cop is a sophisticated Spigot plugin meticulously designed to protect your Minecraft server from players attempting to use VPNs. By harnessing the capabilities of both ProxyCheck.io and VPNAPI.io, VPN Cop offers a comprehensive and robust solution to detect and block VPNs, ensuring a fair, safe, and enjoyable gaming environment for all players.</p>
    
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dual VPN Check Protection: VPN Cop integrates with both ProxyCheck.io and VPNAPI.io, two leading services in VPN detection. This dual integration provides a more extensive and reliable VPN detection, significantly reducing the chances of false negatives and ensuring maximum protection against VPN users.</li>
        <li>Automatic VPN Blocking: VPN Cop automatically detects and blocks players trying to join your server using a VPN. It sends a customizable message to the kicked player, informing them about the server’s no-VPN policy.</li>
        <li>IP Whitelisting: VPN Cop allows server admins to whitelist specific IP addresses. Players connecting from these IPs will not be checked for VPN usage, ensuring that trusted players can always join your server.</li>
        <li>Whitelist Commands: VPN Cop provides easy-to-use commands for managing the IP whitelist. Admins can add or remove IPs from the whitelist, or view the current whitelist, directly from the server console.</li>
        <li>Persistent Whitelist: The IP whitelist is saved to a config file, so your whitelist settings will persist even if the server is restarted.</li>
        <li>Seamless Integration & Easy Configuration: VPN Cop is designed to seamlessly integrate with your Minecraft server. It’s easy to set up and configure, allowing server admins to customize the plugin’s behavior according to their needs. This allows for a drag and drop experience.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Commands</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>/addipwhitelist <IP>: This command adds a specific IP address to the whitelist. Players connecting from this IP will not be checked for VPN usage, regardless of whether they’re using a VPN or not. This is useful for allowing trusted players to join your server without being affected by the VPN block.</li>
        <li>/removeipwhitelist <IP>: This command removes a specific IP address from the whitelist. Players connecting from this IP will be checked for VPN usage, just like any other player. This is useful if you no longer want to allow a previously whitelisted IP to bypass the VPN block.</li>
        <li>/listipwhitelist: This command lists all the IP addresses currently on the whitelist. This can be helpful for server admins to keep track of which IPs are whitelisted.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Once installed, VPN Cop operates silently in the background, diligently checking every incoming player’s IP against the comprehensive databases of ProxyCheck.io and VPNAPI.io. If a VPN is detected, the player is immediately kicked from the server, ensuring a VPN-free gaming experience for your community.</p>
    
    <h2>Please Note</h2>
    <p>While VPN Cop is designed to provide an additional layer of security for Minecraft servers, it’s important to understand that no VPN detection method is 100% accurate. There may be occasional false positives or negatives. Server admins are advised to monitor the plugin’s performance and report any problems to us.</p>
